## Description
I'll be making a version of the game Snake in pygame. It's a well known and fairly simple game that will help familiarize me with more of python and pygame. 

## Features
- Snake Functionality
	- The player will be able to control the movement of the snake. The snake's body can get longer or shorter
- Randomly Spawning Objects
	- Randomly spawning objects, like food, will need to be placed automatically. The food will increase the length of the snake and disappear when touched
- Visuals 
	- The game will be displayed on a screen through pygame. The visuals will include all necessary information for the game, such as length and location of objects, as well as any visual fluorishes I have time to add

## Challenges
- I have never dealt with user inputs in pygame, so I will have to learn how that works

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The game is playable and has some visual elements that make it look better and feel better to play

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The game is playable

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Pygame display working
  2. Start on snake functionality

- Week 2
  1. Finish snake functionality
  2. Start random spawning objects

- Week N (Final)
  1. Finish random spawning objects and overall gameloop
  2. Any extra visual elements I have time for
