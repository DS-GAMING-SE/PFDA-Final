## Description
This is a simple version of Snake made in pygame. You can use either arrow keys or WASD to move the snake. The game will start once you press any key. Try to collect as much of the red food as you can. Every time you collect one, your snake will get longer. The longer your snake gets, the more challenging it will be to keep growing. Running into any part of yourself or the walls will end the game. Press R to restart the game at any time.
In making this game, I focused less on the final product and more about the python skills needed to make it. I avoided using any tutorials on how to make a game like Snake and instead wanted to figure as much of it out myself as I could. The only resources I used were python documentation and one video helping with pygame inputs, since I had never used pygame inputs before (The tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvV6UxuzH5c).
The entire game is in the snake.py file in the src folder. Any additional libraries required for the game to work are listed in the requirements.txt file. The proposal.md file is the rough plan I had made prior to starting on this project. Overall, I was not able to make as many visual elements as I had hoped, since the normal game mechanics took me a little longer than expected to make.
At one point in development I had worked on trying to make a special animation for losing. The animation would've played the moment the snake hit an obstacle. It would've had each of the snake's segments fade away one at a time starting from the head where the collision happened. Unfortunately, I was not able to get this effect working in time for the project submission, but leftover code for the animation is still present, though it is mostly commented out. If I had more time, I would first work on getting this animation to function.
